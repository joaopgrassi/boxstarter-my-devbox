# boxstarter-my-devbox

Initialy, this will be my playground and my attempt to setup a script that install most of the tools I use daily as a .NET full-stack developer.

# Inspiration:

As I'm learning how to work with Boxstarter/Chocolatey, these awesome repositories helped me a lot. So, definitely check them out:
- [windows-dev-box-setup-scripts](https://github.com/Microsoft/windows-dev-box-setup-scripts)
- [Cacao](https://github.com/laurentkempe/Cacao)

Also, definitely check this Channel 9 talk that happend during Microsoft Build 2018, where the creators Rob Reynolds (Chocolatey) and Matt Wrock (Boxstarter) talk about it:
